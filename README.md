The Codac Logistics Delivery and Fuel Auditor system works by collecting, validating, storing, and analyzing the driver’s fuel and delivery information, then showing a complete audit report. First, the system asks the user to enter the driver’s name using string because text data ito, then the weekly fuel budget using decimal para mas accurate ang financial calculations, and the total distance traveled using double since puwedeng may decimal values ang distance. After that, gumagamit ang system ng while loop para i-validate ang distance input, making sure na ang value ay between 1.0 and 5000.0 kilometers. Kapag mali ang input, magpapakita ng error message at uulitin ng system ang paghingi ng input hanggang maging valid ito. Next, the system tracks the fuel expenses for five days using an array, which helps organize and store the values properly. A for loop is used dahil fixed ang number of days, and for each loop, hinihingi ang fuel expense per day, sine-save ito sa array, at ina-add sa total fuel spent. Once kumpleto na ang data, the system calculates the total fuel spent, average daily fuel cost, and fuel efficiency based on distance and fuel usage. After that, kino-compare ng system ang total fuel spent sa fuel budget para malaman kung within budget or over budget ang driver. Finally, the system displays a complete audit report showing the driver’s name, total distance, daily fuel expenses, total fuel spent, average cost, efficiency rating, and budget status. This helps the user easily monitor and evaluate the driver’s fuel usage and overall delivery performance.
